VERY IMPORTANT KEY LEARNINGS

Main Question: HOW ARE BOOKMARKS ADDED INTO FR:Layers

*** VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!!! ***

BackendRenderer only updates UserMarks(Bookmarks, LocalAds, ...) through FlushUserMarksMessage to FrontendRenderer
they are called Flush because just like printf and stuff they locally buffer it(through the Batcher in this case)
so Flushing means I'm done will all my edits, send it out to be rendered

SO, basically don't waste your time. If a UserMarksContainer calls NotifyChanges()
    frontendRenderer WILL HEAR ABOUT IT!!!

*** VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!!! ***
FrontendRenderer::1021::GetVisiblePOI is where clicks are interpreated to find what was "intended" to be
    selected on the map(it does distance calculation from point of click and checks against some minimum)

You need to clean gradle project and compile again to changes to take effect


checkout FR::1476::OnTap && m_blockTapEvents(who sets it, and why do they want to block taps)

FR::1499::m_tapEventInfoFn taps are passed to it

Extract tap info in framework.cpp::2404::OnTapEvent(check the call 2443::ActivateMapSelection)

TODOs:

    1) Implement the banking "skeleton" app
    2) Customize PlacePageView(make it display "Call", "name", "Type?(bank, shop)", "working hours")
    3) Make the bank places be downloadable
    4) Figure out how to embed the map in a fragment so it won't cover the whole screen(half-half)
    5) Package Ethiopia's map with the app(can just copying it to data/ work?)
    6) Fix: Zooming crashes at level 15
    7) Compile it to release version

======================================================================================
You need to invoke CustomBankLayer inside FR::RenderScene(otherwise, it won't be painted)
    so figure out where and when it needs to be called

update 1306 :: BuildOverlayTree     
    - Add CustomBankMarkLayer to array
look into GetDepthLayer()           BEEN HANDLED
    - If we need to add anything

what are the different UserMark Layers, how do they differ, are they drawn differently
The layer is defined by <UserMarkRenderData::m_state>
easiest way to solve layer clash is define a custom_bank layer

BEGIN_QUESTION: 
    How do user mark objects get rendered?

Answer:
drape_frontend/     
    user_mark_generator
        actually converts the user marks into vertex array through GenerateUserMarksGeometry
    user_mark_shapes
        defines the data structures that contain actually drawing data, also it is what 
            {@code user_mark_generator} calls to perform OpenGL conversion
    user_marks_provider
        defines ({@code UserPointMark} that is extended by Bookmark, LocalAds, ...) and UserMarksProvider

    How does PLacePageView inside Android work

Answer:

    Adds the appropriate 473::PlacePageView buttons
